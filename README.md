2. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd projectdesic
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Configure the .env files
5. Start the server in the backend and frontend:

## Tecnologies
* ReactJS: React es una biblioteca de JavaScript para construir interfaces de usuario.
* Express: Express.js es un marco de aplicaciones web de Node.js utilizado para crear servidores y aplicaciones web.
* Sequelize: Sequelize es una biblioteca de Node.js que se utiliza para interactuar con bases de datos SQL y es especialmente Ãºtil en aplicaciones que utilizan Node.js.
* Database: MySQL
## Tecnologies comparation
### React.js:
#### Advantages:
* Virtual DOM: React uses a Virtual DOM that improves performance by minimizing direct manipulations in the DOM, leading to greater efficiency.
* Component reusability: React's component-based architecture facilitates code reuse and the construction of modular interfaces.
* Large community and support: React has an active community with a wide variety of libraries and resources available.
#### Disadvantages:
* Learning curve: It may have an initial learning curve, especially for those new to the component-based programming paradigm.
* Tool decisions: Being only a library for the user interface, additional decisions must be made regarding routing, state management, etc.
### Node.js (Runtime environment for JavaScript on the server):
#### Advantages:
* JavaScript on both sides: The ability to use JavaScript on both the client and server sides facilitates synchronization between the frontend and backend.
* Asynchronous handling: Node.js is designed to be non-blocking and handle multiple connections simultaneously, which is beneficial for scalable applications.
* NPM (Node Package Manager): NPM is a robust package management system that facilitates the integration of third-party modules and libraries.
#### Disadvantages:
* Single-threaded: Although asynchrony is an advantage, the fact that Node.js is single-threaded can be a drawback for certain CPU-intensive tasks.

## Planification
I started on November 13, so my planning was a little messy. I tried to use the agile method, but I had a lot to do in only one month. Initially, I was going to plan, but the development issues took more time than I expected. This type of planning is very effective, however, I didn't have enough time to finish all parts of the project.
## Conclusion
Although I only worked on this project for a month, I learned a lot about the development of an app. After this time, I realized that I am slower than I thought, so for the next projects, I know which parts I need to focus on more.
